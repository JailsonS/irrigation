## About
This repository contains the scripts used in the classification of the irrigation theme. We recommend that you read the Irrigation Appendix (**COLOCAR LINK**)  of the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (**ATBD**), since important informations about the classification methodology can be found in there.  For the collection 5 of MapBiomas, we have two irrigation subclasses, both mapped from 2000 to 2019:

 - Central Pivot Irrigation System
 - Other Irrigation System (some study areas of the Brazilian semi-arid region)

## How to use

You can follow the instructions for each subclass in the links bellow.

 - [Central Pivot Irrigation System](./central-pivots) instructions;
 - [Other Irrigation System](./other-irrigation-systems) instructions.
